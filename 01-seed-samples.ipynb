Initially composing light-hearted and irreverent works, he also wrote serious, sombre and religious pieces beginning in the 1930s.

The Galactic Empire is nearing completion of the Death Star, a space station with the power to destroy entire planets. Type classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language. Messages can be sent to and received from ports, but these messages must obey the so-called \"port protocol.\" Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom.
